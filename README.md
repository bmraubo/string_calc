# string_calc
CI-backed String Calculator Kata

## Instructions

## Brief

### Functional Requirements

- Complete the first 5 steps of the [String Calculator kata](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1), validated with a passing test suite.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Code is implemented using the Red-Green-Refactor technique.
- Each step of the String Calculator kata should be developed in a separate branch and merged in to the `main` branch via a pull request.
- The repo provides instructions for a user to clone and run locally, with tests. Do not assume the user has strong experience in the language you'll be working in.
- A CI pipeline, which runs the application tests as part of branch pushes and merge requests, is up and running _before_ the first code pull request is filed.
- The repo is set to block merges to `main` unless the pipelines are passing.

### Languages / Tools

- The apprentice is free to use whatever language they prefer, ideally the language they feel most comfortable with (likely to be the one used for their 8th Light application)
- Any test runner is acceptable
- The apprentice should not need to bring in other dependencies at this stage

 ### Learning Objectives

This is more of a process exercise than a programming one, with the learning objectives designed to give you a solid foundation for all apprenticeship projects at 8th Light:

- Familiarity with Git branching, merging and code review
- Introduction to the concept of a walking skeleton
- Understand the basics of continuous integration and why it's useful

### Requirements and Setup

### Tests

### Continuous Integration

### Walking Skeleton

### GitHub Actions/Automation

The requirements are that each pull request is automatically tested, and cannot be merged unless the tests are passed.

The starting point would be a test file with no tests. The first pull request would include the basic tests, as well as the features tested - however the framework would already be in place, satisfying the brief requirements. 

This has the added benefit of expending the number of tests done with each pull request automatically.
